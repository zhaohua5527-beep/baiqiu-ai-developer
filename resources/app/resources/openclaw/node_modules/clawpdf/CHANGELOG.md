# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- Added a zero-dependency `clawpdf` CLI for text extraction, JSON output, stdin input, page rendering, and password-protected PDFs.
- Added inline terminal PNG rendering for CLI image output with Kitty, Ghostty, Konsole, WezTerm, and iTerm-compatible terminals.
- Added syntax highlighting and polished copy buttons to the documentation site code blocks.
- Expanded README usage examples and fixed copy-pasteable docs snippets.
- Restyled the GitHub Pages documentation site with a gogcli-like docs shell, home hero, search, page heroes, and canonical custom-domain URLs.

## 0.2.0

- Redesigned the public API around `createEngine`, `openPdf`, `extractPdf`, one-based pages, typed errors, raw PNG bytes, and opt-in adapters.
- Added Node path, URL, and `Blob` input normalization.
- Added browser and adapter package exports.
- Refactored PDFium lifetime handling so engine disposal closes open documents and top-level extraction can release its shared engine.
- Added validation for render and extraction limits before PDFium allocation.
- Fixed explicit `pages` extraction so the default page cap no longer truncates the list.
- Increased the PDFium form-fill info buffer used for form rendering.
- Added password support to the top-level extraction helper.
- Added a maximum rendered image dimension cap for extraction fallback.
- Added broader PDF extraction, rendering, password, error, PNG, and CI coverage.
- Added a GitHub Pages documentation site with one `docs/*.md` page per feature.
- Removed external comparison references from the public README and docs.
